# COCOBOD, Accountability, and the Politics of Narrative

Something calculated is unfolding again.

The moment Ghana confronts structural failures inherited from the past, a familiar playbook surfaces:

- Manufacture urgency  
- Plant suspicion  
- Weaponise speculation  
- Then pin a decades-deep institutional crisis on whoever currently occupies the chair  

This time the target is **COCOBOD**. More precisely, **Randy Abbey**.

> **Quick Insight**
>
> Structural crises do not appear overnight.  
> When long-term institutional stress is reduced to a single name or a single year, it is usually politics — not analysis.

The script is simple: rewrite history fast enough and hope the public forgets who built the cracks in the foundation.

But the cocoa sector is not naïve.

Farmers know.  
Licensed buying companies know.  
Transporters know.  
Rural communities know.  

They have lived through every season of this slow erosion.

This crisis did not start in 2025.  
It did not start with Randy Abbey.

## A Long Institutional History

COCOBOD leadership has rotated across governments, each era leaving distinct footprints.

- **John Henry Newman (exit around 2001)** — The board transitioned into a new phase.  
- **Isaac Osei (appointed 2006 under President Kufuor)** — Presided over strong production growth and cocoa road expansion, even as financing commitments began accumulating and later strained the board’s balance sheet.  
- **Anthony Fofie (2008–2013, Mills to early Mahama administration)** — Emphasised price stabilisation and farmer support while borrowing pressures steadily increased.  
- **Dr. Stephen Kwabena Opuni (2013–2017 under President Mahama)** — Drove aggressive fertiliser and productivity interventions even as procurement controversies and rising operational costs became entrenched public concerns.  
- **Joseph Boahen Aidoo (2017–early 2025 under President Akufo-Addo)** — Navigated escalating production volatility linked to illegal mining expansion, disease outbreaks, climate stress, and mounting debt exposure tied to forward sales financing and cocoa road commitments, raising persistent sustainability warnings.  

By the time **Randy Abbey** assumed office in 2025 under President Mahama’s second term, debt exposure, infrastructure liabilities, market volatility, and declining production had already converged into a fragile institutional position.

These pressures span governments.  
They span parties.  
They span years.

## The Structural Reality

Debt piled up.  
Forward sales tightened.  
Production slipped under the weight of galamsey and climate shocks.  
Operational costs ballooned.  
Audit concerns surfaced.  
Borrowing increased simply to sustain liquidity.

None of this is partisan fiction.  
It is documented history.

To suggest this complexity suddenly materialised because of one CEO is not serious analysis. It is narrative engineering. And the timing is revealing.

Macroeconomic indicators are stabilising.  
The cedi is regaining footing.  
Investor sentiment is cautiously improving.  
National anti-corruption conversations are intensifying.  

Suddenly, panic is manufactured around COCOBOD.

## The Politics of Fear

Woven into the hysteria is the recycled fear word **“haircut,”** deployed as if repetition alone could trigger old trauma.

Ghanaians remember the real haircut of the Ofori-Atta debt restructuring era. They remember who presided over that chapter.

Today’s miracle narrative is echoed by a desperate choir hoping anxiety will achieve what evidence cannot.

Randy Abbey did not:

- Create legacy debt  
- Design the forward sales architecture  
- Initiate controversial procurement regimes  
- Unleash global cocoa price volatility  

He inherited a sector already under structural stress.

That does not place him above scrutiny.

If there is misconduct, prove it.  
If there are conflicts of interest, investigate them.  
If there are irregularities, publish them.  

Accountability must be evidence-driven, not headline-driven.

## Why COCOBOD Matters

COCOBOD is too strategic for theatrical blame games.

It:

- Funds education  
- Stabilises foreign exchange  
- Sustains rural livelihoods  
- Anchors national agriculture  

Turning it into political theatre reveals opposition desperation, not governance concern.

The sector needs:

- Discipline  
- Transparency  
- Reform velocity  
- Mandate clarity  

It does not need panic choreography.

## Let Institutions Work

If allegations exist, bring documents.  
If audits exist, publish them.  
If procurement concerns exist, file them formally — as the Hon. Assafuah petition to CHRAJ and OSP has done.

Ghana has institutions.

Let evidence, not noise, determine what is true.

Speculation is not oversight.  
Noise is not reform.

The NPP’s miracle choristers trying to offload historical responsibility onto current leadership may soon realise the public is no longer easily distracted.

Citizens now:

- Read balance sheets  
- Track commodity cycles  
- Remember policy decisions  

This time the audience is not passive.  
This time the record matters.  
And this time, Ghana is watching closely.
